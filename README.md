Vid2Comic â€“ Project Description
ðŸ”¹ Concept

Vid2Comic is a web-based application that transforms videos into comic-style storyboards. The system extracts frames from uploaded videos, applies AI-driven artistic filters and scene summarization, and arranges them into sequential comic pages with speech bubbles, captions, and panel layouts.

The goal is to make storytelling visual, fun, and automated â€” whether for creators, educators, or casual users.

ðŸ”¹ Workflow (Step by Step)

Upload Video

User uploads a video file (MP4, MOV, etc.) through the web interface.

Frame Extraction

Backend (Python) extracts keyframes using scene detection (OpenCV / ffmpeg).

Removes redundant frames to capture only important scene changes.

AI Processing

Style Transfer / Comic Filters: Convert each frame into a comic-style illustration (using deep learning models like CartoonGAN, Stable Diffusion with comic LoRAs, or OpenCV-based filters for lighter versions).

Speech/Subtitle Integration (if available): Use speech-to-text (Whisper API or Web Speech API) to extract dialogues and map them to frames.

Panel Generation

Frames are arranged into panels with a dynamic layout (grid, split panels, or full-page splash).

Text bubbles are added where dialogue exists.

Page Assembly

Comic panels are combined into full comic pages (JPG/PNG or downloadable PDF).

Users can preview and edit (move bubbles, change panel style, etc.).

Export

User downloads the final comic book version of their video.

ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack

Frontend (UI/UX)

HTML, CSS, JavaScript (initial version)

React.js (for scalable, modern frontend with state management & editor features)

Backend

Python (Flask/FastAPI in app.py)

Handles video upload, frame extraction, AI model calls, and comic assembly

AI Models

Frame extraction: OpenCV, ffmpeg

Comic-style transformation: CartoonGAN / Stable Diffusion + LoRA comic models

Dialogue extraction: Whisper API or Web Speech API

Optional emotion analysis for expressive bubbles

Storage

MongoDB (metadata: user, video info, panel layouts)

Local/Cloud storage for generated images & PDFs

Deployment

Cloud hosting (AWS / GCP / Vercel for frontend, backend on EC2 or serverless functions)

ðŸ”¹ Advanced Features (Scaling Up)

Dark Mode & Modern UI (React upgrade with Tailwind UI)

Custom Comic Styles (Manga, Western, Pop Art, Minimalist)

Speech Bubble Editing (drag-and-drop in frontend)

Story Summarization (GPT to generate short captions instead of raw subtitles)

Download as PDF / ePub

Social Sharing (publish your comics online)
